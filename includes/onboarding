<p>The Eyowo Developer API is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">RESTful</a>
web service that provides developers with a powerful set of resources that can be utilized to build rich applications
backed by Eyowo payment services.</p>

<p>The API makes use of standard HTTP request methods and response codes. The Developer API supports both form-encoded
and standard JSON requests. All responses rendered by the API are in JSON format.</p>

<p>Feel free to make use of the sandbox to test integrations with the provided endpoints.
It is a secure space created specifically for you to familiarize yourself with our services.</p>

<p>We are constantly working on new features to help you build more feature rich applications.
As such we constantly update this documentation with new resources. Follow us
<a href="https://twitter.com/eyowo" target="_blank">@eyowo</a>
to stay up to date on new API releases.</p>
<h2 id='getting-started'>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The first step to integrating your application with the Eyowo API is the creation of a developer account.
Navigate to the <a href="https://developer.eyowo.com" target="_blank">Eyowo developer website</a> from a browser of your choice to
register an account. A valid email address and password is required for registration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dashboard/register.jpeg" alt="Eyowo developer registration page" /></p>

<p>Upon registration you will be redirected to the login page. Go ahead and login with your provided details.
On successful login you will be redirected to your developer API dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dashboard/create-app.jpeg" alt="API dashboard" /></p>

<p>Your dashboard provides you with tools that will help you:
<ul>
  <li>Create and manage multiple Eyowo applications.</li>
  <li>Manage user wallets you have access privileges to.</li>
  <li>View and generate application credentials.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2 id='creating-an-application'>Creating an Application</h2>
<p>Having successfully registered and access the dashboard, let&#39;s go ahead and create a new application. Click the
<strong>Create new App</strong> button and input a unique name for your application. You can name your app whatever you want but
for this guide we will call it eyowo-js-test. Once that&#39;s done click submit. You should now see your app on the dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dashboard/dashboard.jpeg" alt="Dashboard with app" /></p>
<h2 id='application-credentials'>Application Credentials</h2>
<p>There are two crucial credentials for every Eyowo app. They are:
<ul>
  <li>App Key: This is a security credential for all API requests. It is used to identify your application.</li>
  <li>App Secret: This credential is used for the generation of cryptographic cyphers to securely encrypt your API requests.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><img src="/images/dashboard/app-credentials.jpeg" alt="Application credentials" /></p>

<p>Both your app key and app secret can be accessed via the dashboard by clicking your desired application. Your app secret
can be revealed by clicking the <strong>Get Secret Key</strong> button on your dashboard.</p>

<aside class="warning">Never expose your application credentials to a third party. These are highly sensitive secrets
and must be treated as such</aside>
